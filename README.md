# hello-world
My first repository. May 10, 2020. Just five short days after leaving Missouri for the last time. :(
I guess I don't really have a lot to say about myself at this particular moment in time. All I really want at this point is to make myself so good at coding that even David can't keep up with me. I will be better than he is at programming. I have to be better than him at something, and this has to be it. That's really all.
